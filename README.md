# Project Description

This project allows the user to pull reviews for a user-specified product from Amazon and perform sentiment analysis. Product reviews are scraped from Amazon.com using the Amazon Web Scraper API, and sentiment analysis is performed in Python.


# Getting Started

1. Use Amazon Product Review Scraper.ipynb to scrape product reviews from Amazon.com and save it to a .csv file.
2. Perform sentiment analysis based on the user-specified product reviews (in progress).


# Troubleshooting

If the .ipynb files do not load on GitHub, please copy each .ipynb GitHub URL directly into:
https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/

* This is a GitHub issue with Jupyter Notebook compatibility
